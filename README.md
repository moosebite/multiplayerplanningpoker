# fall-2019-multiplayer-planning-poker
* This branch deals with rendering the player list component.
    *It is not yet hooked up to the backend, but serves as an example for frontend practice.
    *This branch has been copied from development, but will be updated later (as of 10/9 at 1:51 PM) to hold my copy of the code

*Be sure to install bootstrap using 'npm i bootstrap'
